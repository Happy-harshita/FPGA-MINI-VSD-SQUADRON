## Hardware Components:

## FPGA Development Board:

**Selection Criteria**: Consider the number of available I/O pins, on-board peripherals (like ADCs or the ability to interface with external ADCs), processing power (logic cells, DSP slices), memory resources (Block RAM), and the availability of relevant communication interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet PHY if needed).

Example: Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA Development Board, Intel Cyclone V FPGA Development Kit. The specific choice will depend on the complexity and number of sensors you plan to interface.

**Sensors:** Type: Specify the types of sensors you intend to use based on the application (e.g., temperature sensors like LM35 or DHT22, pressure sensors like BMP180, accelerometers like ADXL345, gas sensors, etc.).

**Interface:** Identify the communication protocol required by each sensor (e.g., analog output, I2C, SPI, UART). This will dictate how you interface them with the FPGA.

**Quantity:** Determine the number of each type of sensor you will be integrating.

**Communication Interface Hardware:** UART Transceiver (e.g., MAX232 or USB-to-UART converter): Required to interface with the FPGA's UART pins for serial communication with a computer or other devices.

SPI/I2C Interface Hardware (if needed): Depending on the external devices you plan to communicate with beyond basic UART.

Ethernet PHY and Connector (if Ethernet communication is required): For network-based data transmission.

## Power Supply:

Specify the voltage and current requirements for the FPGA development board, sensors, and any other peripheral components.

Choose an appropriate power supply unit or voltage regulators.

**Cables and Connectors:** Various jumper wires, ribbon cables, and connectors to interface the different hardware components.

## Software Tools:

FPGA Development Software:

Vendor-Specific IDE:

Xilinx: Vivado Design Suite or ISE (depending on the FPGA board).

Intel (Altera): Quartus Prime.

Lattice: Diamond.

These IDEs provide tools for HDL (VHDL or Verilog) coding, synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation.

HDL Simulation Software (Optional but Recommended):

Examples: ModelSim, QuestaSim (often integrated or compatible with vendor IDEs).

Used for verifying the functionality of your HDL code before implementation on the FPGA.

Serial Communication Software (for testing and data reception):

Examples: PuTTY, Tera Term, Arduino Serial Monitor (if interfacing with an Arduino).

Used on a host computer to receive and view the data transmitted via UART.

## Programming Cable and Software:

Specific cable (e.g., JTAG programmer) and software provided by the FPGA vendor to upload the generated bitstream to the FPGA board.

## FPGA-Based Digital Oscilloscope

**Hardware Components:**

**FPGA Development Board:**

Selection Criteria: Similar to the sensor data acquisition system, consider I/O pins, on-board peripherals (especially high-speed ADCs or the ability to interface with external high-speed ADCs), processing power, memory resources, and potentially display interface capabilities (e.g., VGA connector, LCD interface).

Example: Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA Development Board with high-speed ADC interface, Intel Cyclone V GX Starter Kit with HSMC connector for ADC cards.

High-Speed Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):

Resolution (bits): Determines the vertical resolution of your oscilloscope. Higher resolution provides more detail in the amplitude measurement.

Sampling Rate (samples per second): Determines the maximum frequency of signals you can accurately capture (Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem).

Bandwidth: The range of frequencies the ADC can accurately convert.

Number of Channels: Typically one or two channels for basic oscilloscopes.

Interface to FPGA: Crucial - often high-speed parallel interfaces, LVDS, or JESD204B. The FPGA board must have compatible interface capabilities.

Clock Source: A stable and accurate clock source for the ADC and the FPGA's timing logic (sampling clock, timebase generation). This might be an on-board oscillator or an external clock generator.

Display Module:

Type:

LCD (Character or Graphical): Suitable for basic waveform display and text-based information. Requires a parallel or serial interface.

VGA Monitor: Offers higher resolution and color capabilities. Requires a VGA controller to be implemented on the FPGA.

HDMI Monitor: Provides high-definition display. Requires an HDMI controller on the FPGA.

Interface to FPGA: Parallel data bus, SPI, I2C for LCDs; digital video signals (RGB, sync signals) for VGA/HDMI.

Input Probes/Connectors: BNC connectors are standard for oscilloscope inputs.

Consider the impedance matching requirements for the probes.

User Interface Components (Optional but Recommended):

Buttons: For controlling triggering modes, timebase settings, voltage scales, etc.

Rotary Encoder: For fine-tuning parameters.

Power Supply:

Provide appropriate power to the FPGA board, ADC, display, and other components.

Software Tools:

FPGA Development Software: (Same as for Sensor Data Acquisition)

Xilinx Vivado/ISE, Intel Quartus Prime, Lattice Diamond.

HDL Simulation Software (Optional but Recommended): (Same as for Sensor Data Acquisition)

ModelSim, QuestaSim.

Programming Cable and Software: (Same as for Sensor Data Acquisition)

Waveform Analysis Software (Optional):

For analyzing captured data on a host computer if you plan to transfer data for offline analysis.

Examples: Python.

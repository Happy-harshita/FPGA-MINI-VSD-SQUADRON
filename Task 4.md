## Study the Existing Code:

- Access the uart_tx_sense project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.

- Review the Verilog code to understand how sensor data is acquired and transmitted.

## Design Documentation:

- Create a block diagram depicting the integration of the sensor module with the UART transmitter.

- Develop a circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA, sensor, and the receiving device.

## Implementation:

- Set up the hardware according to the circuit diagram, ensuring proper sensor interfacing.

- Synthesize and load the Verilog code onto the FPGA.

## Testing and Verification:

- Stimulate the sensor and observe the transmitted data on a serial terminal to verify accurate sensor data transmission.

## Documentation:

- Assemble the block diagram, circuit diagram, code analysis, and testing results into a detailed report.
Record a short video demonstrating the system transmitting sensor data via UART.

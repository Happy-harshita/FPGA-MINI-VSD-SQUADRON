## Literature Review:

### Explore existing projects and resources related to the selected theme.

- The literature review for projects focusing on either "Real-Time Sensor Data Acquisition and Transmission Systems" or "FPGA-Based Digital Oscilloscopes" shares significant overlap in fundamental areas. 

- Both themes heavily rely on the FPGA's capabilities for high-speed data acquisition and real-time processing.

- For sensor data acquisition and transmission, the literature would explore methods for interfacing diverse sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, acceleration) with the FPGA, focusing on signal conditioning, analog-to-digital conversion, and efficient data handling within the FPGA's architecture. 

- Research in this area also emphasizes the implementation of communication protocols like UART, SPI, or Ethernet on the FPGA for transmitting the acquired and potentially processed sensor data to external systems.

- Conversely, the FPGA-based digital oscilloscope theme concentrates on acquiring analog signals through an ADC, implementing sophisticated triggering and timebase control within the FPGA, and subsequently processing and displaying the captured waveforms on a screen.

- The literature for this theme would delve into high-speed sampling techniques, digital signal processing algorithms suitable for FPGA implementation, and methods for driving display interfaces in real-time.

- The connection lies in the core functionalities: both themes necessitate robust data acquisition from external sources (sensors or analog inputs), efficient data management and real-time processing within the FPGA, and a means of conveying the processed information (transmission via protocols or display on a screen). 

- Therefore, a comprehensive literature review for either project would invariably touch upon ADC interfacing techniques with FPGAs, memory management strategies for real-time data, and the implementation of digital logic for control and processing. 

- While the oscilloscope project emphasizes signal visualization and analysis, and the sensor system focuses on data transmission and potentially different forms of processing tailored to sensor data, the underlying principles of FPGA-based data acquisition and real-time handling form a crucial common ground explored within the relevant body of literature.

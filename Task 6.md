## Objectives:

Execute the project plan by developing, testing, and validating the system.​

Document the entire process comprehensively and create a short video demonstrating the project's functionality.​

## Steps:

### Develop FPGA Modules:

Write Verilog or VHDL code for each module, such as sensor interfaces, data processing units, and UART communication blocks.​

## Simulate and Test Modules:

Utilize simulation tools to verify the functionality of each module before hardware implementation.​
Integrate and Test Hardware:

Assemble the hardware components based on the circuit diagrams.​

Program the FPGA with the developed code.​

Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system operates as intended.​

## Document the Project:

Compile comprehensive documentation, including system overview, design schematics, annotated code listings, and testing procedures.​

Create a short video demonstrating the project's functionality.​

## Publish on GitHub:

Use the same GitHub repository for the project.​

Upload all project files, including code, documentation, and the demonstration video.​

## Deliverables:

Fully functional project implementation.​

Comprehensive project documentation on GitHub.​

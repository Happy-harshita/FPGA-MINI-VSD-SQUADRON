## THE IMPLEMENTATION:-

FPGA Development Board:

Ensure you have your iCE40 UP5K development board.

Connect the power supply to the board as per its documentation.

Connect your programming cable (usually USB) from your computer to the FPGA board for synthesis and loading later.

External Clock (if needed):

If your development board doesn't have an onboard 12 MHz oscillator connected to pin 20, you will need to connect an external 12 MHz oscillator to this pin (hw_clk). 

Refer to your board's documentation for the exact pin location and any specific requirements (e.g., voltage levels).

Serial Connection:

Obtain a serial-to-USB adapter.

Connect the UART TX pin of the FPGA (pin 14) to the RX pin of the serial-to-USB adapter.

Connect the GND pin of your FPGA board to the GND pin of the serial-to-USB adapter. This is crucial for proper serial communication.

Plug the USB end of the adapter into your computer.

RGB LED:

The RGB LED (connected to pins 39, 40, and 41) is likely already integrated into your development board. 

You shouldn't need to make any external connections for it based on the current top.v file.

Sensor Interfacing (This is the crucial part that depends on your sensor):

Identify your sensor's interface: Is it digital output, I2C, SPI, or analog?

Consult your sensor's datasheet: Understand its pinout, power requirements, communication protocol details, and any necessary external components.

Connect the sensor to the FPGA:

Power: Connect the sensor's power pin to an appropriate voltage supply on your FPGA board (e.g., 3.3V or 5V), ensuring it matches the sensor's requirements.

Connect the sensor's ground pin to the FPGA board's ground.

Signal Pins: Connect the sensor's data or control signals to available GPIO pins on the iCE40 FPGA.

You will need to choose appropriate FPGA pins and then update the VSDSquadronFM.pcf file with these pin assignments.

Example (Digital Output Sensor): If your sensor has a digital output pin, connect it to a chosen GPIO pin on the FPGA (e.g., pin P1).

You would then add a line like set_io sensor_out P1 to your VSDSquadronFM.pcf file.

Example (I2C Sensor): If your sensor uses I2C, connect its SDA and SCL pins to two chosen GPIO pins on the FPGA (e.g., P2 and P3). 

Add corresponding lines to your PCF file: set_io i2c_sda P2 and set_io i2c_scl P3. 

You might also need pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines, depending on your sensor and board.


Example (SPI Sensor): Connect MOSI, MISO, SCLK, and CS pins to chosen GPIO pins on the FPGA and update the PCF file accordingly.

Example (Analog Sensor): You'll need an ADC. If your board has one, consult its documentation. 

If not, you'll need to connect an external ADC (likely using I2C or SPI) to the FPGA.

2. Synthesize and Load the Verilog Code onto the FPGA:



Install FPGA Toolchain: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your computer (e.g., Yosys, NextPNR, Icepack, Iceprog for iCE40). 

These are likely already set up if you have been working with this repository.

Modify Verilog Code (top.v):

Declare Sensor Ports: Add input or output ports to the top module in top.v corresponding to the FPGA pins you connected to your sensor.

For example, if you connected a digital output sensor to pin P1 and named it sensor_out in the PCF, add input wire sensor_out, to the top module's port list.


Implement Sensor Logic: Write Verilog code within the top.v module to:

Read the data from your sensor (e.g., directly read the sensor_out input, implement I2C/SPI communication to get data).

Process or format the sensor data as needed.

Assign the sensor data (or a representation of it) to the txbyte input of the DanUART module. 

You will likely need to modify the line uart_tx_8n1 DanUART (.clk (clk_9600), .txbyte("D"), .senddata(frequency_counter_i[24]), .tx(uarttx)); to use your sensor data.

Modify the condition for the senddata signal to trigger transmission when new sensor data is available. 

You might want to trigger it periodically after reading the sensor or based on a change in the sensor's value.

Update PCF File (VSDSquadronFM.pcf): Add the pin assignments for the sensor interface signals you chose in the hardware setup. For example:

set_io sensor_out <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

For I2C:

set_io i2c_sda <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

set_io i2c_scl <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

For SPI:

set_io spi_mosi <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

set_io spi_miso <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

set_io spi_sclk <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

set_io spi_cs <FPGA_PIN_NUMBER>

Synthesize, Place, and Route: Navigate to the uart_tx_sense project directory in your terminal and run the make command. This will execute the synthesis, place and route steps 
usingYosys and NextPNR.

Generate Bitstream: If the synthesis and place and route are successful, the make command will also generate the bitstream file (top.bin).

Load onto FPGA: Connect your FPGA board to your computer via the programming cable. Run the make flash command. This will use iceprog to load the top.bin file onto the iCE40 FPGA.

## TESTING:-

**1. Stimulate the Sensor:**

The method for stimulating your sensor will depend entirely on the type of sensor you are using. Consider the following examples:

Temperature/Humidity Sensor: You might breathe on it, hold it in your hand to warm it up, or expose it to different humidity levels.

Light Sensor: Cover it with your hand or shine a light source on it.

Proximity Sensor: Move an object closer to or further away from the sensor.

Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Gently tilt or move the sensor.

Digital Input (e.g., Button): Press or release the button.

\I2C/SPI Sensor: The stimulation might involve the environment the sensor is measuring, and you should observe if the readings change accordingly.

**2. Open a Serial Terminal:**

On your computer, open a serial terminal program. Common options include:

PuTTY (Windows, Linux): A versatile terminal emulator.

Tera Term (Windows): Another popular and free terminal emulator.

minicom (Linux, macOS): A text-based serial communication program.

screen (Linux, macOS): A full-screen window manager that can also act as a serial terminal.

Arduino Serial Monitor (if you have the Arduino IDE installed): Simple and often sufficient for basic serial communication.

**3. Configure the Serial Port:**

You need to configure the serial terminal to match the UART settings in your Verilog code. Based on the Makefile and our analysis, these settings are likely:

Baud Rate: 9600 (as defined by BAUDS=9600 in the Makefile).

Data Bits: 8 (implied by the uart_tx_8n1 module name and standard practice).

Parity: None (implied by the 8n1 in the module name).

Stop Bits: 1 (implied by the 8n1 in the module name).

Flow Control: None.

In your serial terminal program, you will need to:

Select the correct COM port (Windows) or device file (Linux/macOS) for your serial-to-USB adapter.

This is usually something like COM3 or higher on Windows, and /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux/macOS (the Makefile suggests /dev/ttyUSB0). 

You might need to check your operating system's device manager or list of serial ports to identify the correct one.

Enter the configuration settings (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, flow control).

**4. Observe the Transmitted Data:**

Once the serial terminal is configured and connected, you should start seeing data appearing in the window if your FPGA is correctly transmitting.

Initial Check: If you haven't modified the txbyte in top.v yet, you should still see the character "D" being transmitted periodically (triggered by the counter bit). 

This confirms that the basic UART transmission is working.Sensor Data Verification:

Stimulate your sensor as described in step 1.


Observe if the data in the serial terminal changes in response to the sensor stimulation.

Interpret the Data: The format of the transmitted sensor data will depend on how you implemented the Verilog code. 

You might be sending raw digital readings, formatted ASCII values, or some other representation.

Compare the received data with the expected output from your sensor based on its datasheet and your Verilog implementation.
Example (Digital Output Sensor): If you are sending '1' for active and '0' for inactive.

You should see these characters change when you stimulate the sensor (e.g., press and release a button).
Example (Temperature Sensor sending ASCII): You might see a sequence of ASCII characters representing the temperature value (e.g., "25.5 C").

When you warm the sensor, this value should increase.

**5. Troubleshooting:**

If you don't see any data or the data is incorrect:

Double-check your serial port configuration.

Ensure the baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits match your Verilog design.

Verify the COM port/device file is correct.

Check your hardware connections between the FPGA and the serial-to-USB adapter, especially the TX and GND lines.

Ensure your FPGA is programmed correctly with the modified bitstream.

Review your Verilog code for any errors in reading the sensor data, formatting it for transmission, or triggering the senddata signal.

Use a logic analyzer (if available) to probe the uarttx pin on the FPGA to see if the serial data is being generated as expected.

Verification of Accurate Transmission:

To verify accurate transmission:

Compare the received data with the expected sensor readings based on the stimulation you applied and the sensor's specifications.

Consider the data format you implemented. If you are sending raw binary data, you'll need to convert it to a human-readable format to verify its correctness.

Test with different stimulation levels to see if the transmitted data consistently reflects the changes in the sensor's output.
